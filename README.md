# Telium
This project was made for school and is a fun text-based adventure game that was programed by me. I followed a "tutorial" for the main code, but all the other features where done entirely by me.

Packages used in this project are for making the program user-friendly and easy-to-use. Oh except for the random package, had to use that one.
