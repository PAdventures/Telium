When exploring the station, you will always have the ability to move to any adjacent room. Moving between modules cost 1 station power so you must find ways to collect more station power throughout your quest.

Moving between modules can be done by using commands. Here are some examples:

First Prompt: M or MOVE
Second Propmt: 2
-------------------------

Second Prompt: Skipped
