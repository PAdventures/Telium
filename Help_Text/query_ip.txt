Information panels are the only location where you can check the power levels of the Charles Darwin. These panels can be found radnomlu across the station and can be used whenever you come across one.

Information panels also give you the ability to locate the deck that the alien queen is on. However, this ability come with a huge price; the loss of power to the station, and a lot of it. You may only use this ability once, so use it sparingly
