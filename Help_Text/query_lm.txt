Module locking prevents anything from getting out of it or going in it, execpt for you. If you lock alien workers in a module they pose no threat to you.

However, due to Telium, the alien queen, having immense strength, she can prevent you from locking the module that she is in. Use this to your advantage.

Furthermore, if the alien queen tries to escape through a locked module, she will not be able to open it, and can therefore, not use it as an escape route and must find another means of running away.
